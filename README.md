# Hospital_Management_System
This Java code defines a simple Hospital Management System using JDBC for database connectivity.The program comprises three classes: Patients, Doctors, and Appointments, each responsible for managing their respective entities in the system. The Patients class handles patient-related operations such as creating tables, adding & viewing patients, and updating & deleting patient records. Similarly, the Doctors class manages doctor-related functionalities, while the Appointments class handles the booking, viewing, and cancelation of appointments between patients and doctors. The main class, HospitalManagementSystem, serves as the user interface, presenting a menu-driven system for interacting with the database. The user-friendly interface in HospitalManagementSystem makes a solid foundation for healthcare management applications.
